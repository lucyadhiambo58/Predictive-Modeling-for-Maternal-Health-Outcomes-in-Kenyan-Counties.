# Predictive-Modeling-for-Maternal-Health-Outcomes-in-Kenyan-Counties.
**Project Description**

This project focuses on predictive modeling for maternal health outcomes in Kenyan counties using logistic regression. Simulated data was generated for various factors such as age, education, healthcare access, and socioeconomic status, among others. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 94.3% in predicting maternal mortality outcomes, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between positive and negative outcomes.

**Key Achievements**

- Implemented logistic regression for predicting maternal mortality outcomes.

- Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key factors influencing maternal health outcomes.

- Derived actionable recommendations for improving maternal healthcare services based on feature importance.

**Recommendations**

1. Prioritize maternal health programs for HIV/AIDs patients.

2. Focus on nutritional support and maternal mental health interventions.

3. Enhance socioeconomic support and increase access to antenatal care.

4. Improve maternal education, nutritional awareness, and healthcare quality.
